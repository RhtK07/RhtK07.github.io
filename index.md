Hi!




I am a upcoming PhD student at the [Center for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/) of the Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/). My research interests lie in the areas of signal processing, speech recognition and auditory neuroscience. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Mounya Elhilali](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fmetze/interACT/Home.html) and [Prof. Sriram Ganapathy](http://www.leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/sriram/) .
