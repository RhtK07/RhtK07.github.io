Hi!

I am a PhD student at the [Center for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/) of the Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/). My research interests lie in the areas of signal processing, machine learning, deep learning, and neuroscience with applications to robust speech recognition, speech enhancement, auditory and behavioral neuroscience. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Mounya Elhilali](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fmetze/interACT/Home.html).


Before that, I have completed my [Master's in Signal Processing](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/)(2018-20) under the guidance of [Prof. Sriram Ganapathy](http://www.leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/sriram/) from the [Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru](https://iisc.ac.in/), where I continued to work as a Senior Research Fellow(2020-21). While working with Prof. Sriram in the [LEAP Lab](http://leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/), I got the opportunity to work on the problem of Multi-Channel Noise Robust Speech Recognition. Additionally, I was also part of Project COSWARA.

I have worked as an Automation Officer in Hindustan Petroleum, after completing my B.Tech in Electronics and Communication from [Delhi College of Engineering](http://www.dtu.ac.in/).
