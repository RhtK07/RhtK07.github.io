Hi!

I am a PhD student at the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), mentored by [Prof. Mounya Elhilali](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/faculty/elhilali-mounya/). My research interests lie in the areas of signal processing, machine learning, deep learning, and neuroscience with applications to robust speech recognition, speech enhancement, auditory and behavioral neuroscience. 

Before that, I have completed my [Master's in Signal Processing](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/) under the guidance of [Prof. Sriram Ganapathy](http://www.leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/sriram/) from the [Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru](https://iisc.ac.in/), where I continued to work as a Senior Research Fellow(2020-21). While working with Prof. Sriram in the [LEAP Lab](http://leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/), I worked on the problem of Multi-Channel Noise Robust Speech Recognition. Additionally, I was also part of [Project COSWARA](https://coswara.iisc.ac.in/). I have worked as an Automation Officer in Hindustan Petroleum, after completing my B.Tech in Electronics and Communication from [Delhi College of Engineering](http://www.dtu.ac.in/).
