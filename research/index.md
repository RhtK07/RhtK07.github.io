I am interested in enabling machines to learn from multiple modalities of data like text, audio, video, semantics as humans naturally do.

### Ongoing Research

* **Naive Physics**
Advised by [Prof. Mounya Elhilali](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fmetze/interACT/Home.html)

### Past Projects

* **Multi-Channel Noise Robust Speech Recognition**  
Advised by [Prof. Sriram Ganapathy]((http://leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/sriram/)


* **Project COSWARA**  
Advised by [Prof. Sriram Ganapathy](http://leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/sriram/) and [Prof. Prasanta Kumar Ghosh](http://www.ee.iisc.ac.in/people/faculty/prasantg/index.html)  
Project Coswara by Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore attempts the use of cough, speech and breathing sounds for cost-effective and contact-less testing of Covid-19 infection.
